Overview
  purpose
    - basics of ai
    - get excited about ai!

  structure
    - videos
    - quizzes
    - answer videos
    - hw
    - exams

  an ai program is called
    * an intelligent agent

Intelligent Agents
  agent perceives state of enviro thru sensors
  they affect enviro via actuators
  control policy maps the two
  class deals with this relationship loop

Applications of AI
  ai in finance
    - trading agent
    - reads news
    - follows events
    - decisions: buy / sell

  ai in robotics
    - cameras
    - motors
    - voice
    - in web, early crawlers called robots

  ai in games
    - chess agents
    - makes games feel more natural

  ai in medicine
    - diagnostic agents

  ai on the web
    - search
    - "really core artificial intelligence"
    - crawling agent goes to www and retrieves pages
    - stores them
    - analyzes them
    - you issue query

Terminology
  fully vs partially observable
    - fully: what your agent can sense at any pt in time, sufficient to make optimal choice
      - if in poker all cards on table
    - partially: observable not sufficient
      - normal poker game
    - perception action cycle
    * Environment fully observable if sensors can see entire state of environment
    * Partial need internal memory to understand state of environemnt
  deterministic vs stochastic
    - chess deterministic (actions uniquely determine outcome)
    - dice stochastic (random)
  discrete vs continuous
    - discrete finally many choices, things you can sense (chess)
    - continuous space of actions, things you sense infinite (darts)
  benign vs adversarial
    - in benign enviro may be random but not out to get you
    - games like chess (opponent out to get you)

Machine Translation
  - rad
  - build translation model
  - when given text, use this model
  - match shit ton of already translated articles, build algorithm accordingly
